What does the analogy “AI is the new electricity” refer to?
    [x] Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries.
    [] AI runs on computers and is thus powered by electricity, but it is letting computers do things not possible before.
    [] AI is powering personal devices in our homes and offices, similar to electricity.

Which of these are reasons for Deep Learning recently taking off? (Check the three options that apply.)
    [x] We have access to a lot more computational power.
    [] Neural Networks are a brand new field.
    [x] Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition.
    [x] We have access to a lot more data

When building a neural network to predict housing price from features like size, the number of bedrooms, zip code, and wealth, it is necessary to come up with other features in between input and output like family size and school quality. True/False?
    [] True
    [x] False

Which of the following depicts a Sigmoid activation function?
    [x] Figure 2

Images for cat recognition is an example of “structured” data, because it is represented as a structured array in a computer. True/False?
    [] True
    [x] False

A dataset is composed of age and weight data for several people. This dataset is an example of "structured" data because it is represented as an array in a computer. True/False?

A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, and economic growth is an example of “unstructured” data because it contains data coming from different sources. True/False?
    [] True
    [x] False

RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) are good for data with a temporal component. True/False?
    [x] True
    [] False

Recall this diagram of iterating over different ML ideas. Which of the statements below are true? (Check all that apply.)

Recall the diagram of iterating over different ML ideas. Which of the stages shown in the diagram was improved with the use of a better GPU/CPU?
    [x] Some algorithms are specifically designed to run experiments faster.
    [x] Experiments finish faster, producing better ideas through increased iteration tempo.
    [] With larger datasets, the iteration process is faster.

y given enough examples. True/False?
    [x] True
    [] False

Why is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) used for machine translation, say translating English to French? (Check all that apply.)
    [] It is strictly more powerful than a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
    [x] It can be trained as a supervised learning problem.
    [x] It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g., a sequence of words).
